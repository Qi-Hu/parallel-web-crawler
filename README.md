# Parallel Web Crawler

This is a parallel web crawler application, the second project for the [Java Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-nanodegree--nd079) program at Udacity. The project was built based on the [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/cd0381-advanced-java-programming-techniques-projectstarter).

The given source code is a single-threaded legacy web crawler. In this project we upgrade it to a multi-threaded one, and demonstrate that the new web crawler visits more web pages than the legacy one in the same amount of time.
